To run the network, you need to first extract the files in the 'data.zip' and 'Matches.zip'. Then, place the matches.csv in the data folder, and put the data folder in the same folder as the python files. Then, you can just run 'predict individual games' to do as the name says, or run 'run-network' to train a new neural network using the data in the data folder. You can select different matches for the data set by modifying and then running the 'create csv' file.
